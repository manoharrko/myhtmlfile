    <!-- <p>My name is <b>manohar</b> .I'm a B.Com Computer graduate with expertise in <b>Python full-stack development</b>.<br/> This means I can handle both the user-facing side <i>(front-end) </i>and the server-side logic <i>(back-end) </i> of web applications using Python.<br/> My B.Com background gives me a <u>strong understanding of business needs</u> , allowing me to create web applications that are not only functional but also strategically effective.</p> -->

    <p><b>I'm a B.Com Computer graduate with a passion for full-stack development using Python</b> . This unique blend of business acumen and technical expertise empowers me to bridge the gap between user needs and web application functionality. <u> My B.Com background equips me with a keen understanding of business processes, data analysis, and user experience principles</u>. I leverage this knowledge to create web applications that are not just technically sound, but also strategically aligned with business objectives and deliver exceptional user experiences. <u>By wielding the power of Python</u> , I adeptly handle both the front-end <i>(user interface)</i>  and <i>back-end</i>  <i>(server-side logic)</i>  development of web applications, ensuring a seamless and effective user journey. <br/> <b>As</b>  my confidence grew, I ventured beyond the core.<b> Python </b>boasts a vast <i>ecosystem</i>  of libraries and frameworks, each a specialized tool for specific tasks.<u>I honed my skills in frameworks like <b>Django</b>  for building robust web applications, or <b>NumPy</b> and <b> Pandas</b> for wielding the power of data manipulation</u> . Perhaps I delved into machine learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch, unlocking the potential of artificial intelligence. Each new framework broadened my horizons, allowing me to tackle increasingly complex projects</p>
